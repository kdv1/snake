Snake - port of classical game to Famicom (uncompleted)

This is attempt to write a 4KB sized game for diy cartridge. The program 
is run on hardware, but space is too limited to write complete game.

Tools used:
	NES Screen Tool - all graphics work
	ASM6 - 6502 assembler

This program includes some routines from neslib (NES hardware-dependent 
functions by Shiru) - random number generator and unrle.

Building for emulator on Windows: just run build.bat (asm6 must be in PATH).
